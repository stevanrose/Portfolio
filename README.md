# Portfolio
Engineering with purpose — from elegant APIs to resilient systems.

Hi there 👋 I'm **Steve Rose**, a senior software engineer and technical lead based in the UK.  
I specialize in **Java/Spring Boot**, **TypeScript/React**, and **DevOps automation** — building reliable, scalable systems for cloud-native environments.
